2017-06 client wants to pair Pardot with GetSiteControl (custom popup boxes) using Zapier.  
The lack of documentation would suggest or infer that such connections aren't possible 
using a free trial Zapier account. First impressions indicate that allowing 3rd party
tools with user authentication creds that match with other 3rd party tools only spells
trouble. And in this sense, post-implementation long-term support hasn't been considered.

2016-06 on a side note, access to adding GetSiteControl's script to the html of a landing
page or external webpage was instrumental to the success of getting Zapier to connect GSC,
MailChimp, and Blogger together. You could bypass using GetSiteControl altogether if the 
end goal is to populate a MailChimp subscriber list. Heck, you could just use a MailChimp
subscription form for that. But, GSC has a lot of nice free and premium features that goes
beyond a basic subscriber form on a web page.

What you see in Zapier when you test it with GetSiteControl and Pardot is a very long 
list of custom fields in Pardot that you can configure.

2017-07 Success. GetSiteControl is now live and feeding data directly into Pardot/SFDC
using Zapier. And, what's more amazing (now that it's been figured out) is that this
newly captured leads are funneled into a marketing automation campaign using Pardot's
Engagement Studio. Win!

Side note:  

When integrating GetSiteControl with Pardot, GSC pulls all available custom fields from 
Pardot. Let me emphasize **all**. So when you're looking to hook up collected fields with
GSC through GSC's interface, you'll be looking at an extremely long list of not-relevant
fields for your specific lead gen campaign and field naming matters to whoever is doing
this and future integrations.
