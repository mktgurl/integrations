2017-06 client wants to pair Pardot with GetSiteControl (custom popup boxes) using Zapier.  
The lack of documentation would suggest or infer that such connections aren't possible 
using a free trial Zapier account. First impressions indicate that allowing 3rd party
tools with user authentication creds that match with other 3rd party tools only spells
trouble. And in this sense, post-implementation long-term support hasn't been considered.
