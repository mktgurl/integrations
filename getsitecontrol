2017-06 client wants to pair Pardot with GetSiteControl (custom popup boxes) using Zapier.  
The lack of documentation would suggest or infer that such connections aren't possible 
using a free trial Zapier account. First impressions indicate that allowing 3rd party
tools with user authentication creds that match with other 3rd party tools only spells
trouble. And in this sense, post-implementation long-term support hasn't been considered.

2016-06 on a side note, access to adding GetSiteControl's script to the html of a landing
page or external webpage was instrumental to the success of getting Zapier to connect GSC,
MailChimp, and Blogger together. You could,also bypass using GetSiteControl altogether if
the end goal is to populate a MailChimp subscriber list. Heck, you could just use a MailChimp
subscription form for that.

If your GetSiteControl account has several inactive widgets from previous but now inactive
campaigns, all those contact fields will show up as configurable when you use Zapier to
pair GSC + Pardot instead of the field(s) specified in the GSC widget.
